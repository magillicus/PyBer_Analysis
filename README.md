# PyBer Analysis

## Overview
The head of my new company, PyBer, originally tasked me with analyzing all the company's rideshare data from January to May of 2019...and make pretty graphs for the senior management team's visualization purposes. That was cool until she changed her mind. On top of the initial analysis, she then requested for me to create a summary dataframe highlighting ride-sharing data by city type. She also asked that I draw up a multi-line graph that illustrates the total weekly fares for each city type. This is my second week!

## Results

As indicated in the image above, urban communities account for the most rides nationally, followed by suburban and rural communities. This is also the case with the total number of available drivers; urban communities require the most drivers to satisfy the high demand, followed by the suburban community which lies in the middle of the pack, and then the rural communities, who have the fewest number of drivers to cover the relatively low number of requested rides. Total fare amounts also follow a similar trend; they're the lowest in rural areas, moderate in suburban areas and highest in urban cities. Interestingly enough however, the average fares per ride and per driver are the lowest in urban cities, followed by suburban and rural communities. Inner city dwellers generally seem to take a large amount of shorter trips, while the affluent appear to take fewer longer rides, and so pay the most per fare. Suburban folks sit comfortably in the middle of each category.

## Summary

The trends between city types are clearer than not: the inner city population require the highest demand for ridesharing services, followed by suburban communities and then rural ones. Conversely, the rural cities account for the highest fares per ride. Rural cities also account for the least amount of total revenue, followed by suburban households and then urban communities. 

### Concerning the future
1) We need more drivers in rural communities. An influx of drivers would up the supply for potential high-earning clientele, and they may not be as deterred in the future from using ridesharing services due to long wait times.
2) We need slightly fewer drivers in suburban communities. This group has the highest revenue potential. They sit middle of the road in all facets...so lessening the supply while slightly increasing the demand may bring more profit to PyBer.
3) Urban communities are our bread and butter. We generate the most profit from them, and the continuous high supply of drivers seems to match the demand well. The only change I suggest here is to expand the urban community to drive even more business.
